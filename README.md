Future Work: 
	This program can be used to add more skate videos so all skaters can share how to perform sick moves.
	It is very useful to those who wants to watch it in slow motion because difficult skate tricks
	can be hard to watch and learn if it is not in slow motion. 
	
	This program does not only have to be used for skating. It can also be used with other interest
	that people enjoy. However the dictionary and videos will have to changed and edited manually.
	For example, if the user wants to make a video player program to be about cats, the user will have to manually
	find the videos and have it saved in a folder. A dictionary/list of the id of the videos needs to be created. 
	
	We chose our GUI to be based off skate tricks because we enjoy watching simple but difficult tricks.
